About: 

Astrid Seme is an independent graphic designer from Graz, Austria based in Vienna. Rooted within the fields of graphic design and typography her studio works in scopes such as art direction, visual identities, books and other printed matter, e-books, websites and editorial projects.

With regard to the content the work is based on research, concept and economical means of production. Apart of having a clear concept the use of it allows the rules to get pushed and evolve. This is very much part of the studio’s design process. The website presents a selection of design commissions illustrating the studio’s approach, ideas and design methods.

Besides she’s part of [Mark Pezinger Verlag](http://www.markpezinger.de), a publishing house and exhibition-platform for artists’ books.
