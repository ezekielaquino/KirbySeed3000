Text: 

This pocket book brings together a selection of photographies by the Swiss artist Bianca Pedrina. The unpretentious images of architectural elements show her strong engagement with her built environment. She only rarely turns her attention to prestigious buildings but focuses on details that reveal the absurd moments of architecture. 
In combination with the text “Architektur  –  Blick  –  Körper ” by Salome Bessenich the book is reminiscent of an architectural pocket-guide that invites its readers to re-experience their own urbanity. 
The layout of the book follows the content: The German and English texts have their very own “architecture” thus typeset in two different grids. The photographies pup-up coincidentally, following Pedrinas wandering practice.
