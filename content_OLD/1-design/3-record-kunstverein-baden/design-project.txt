Text: 

Past forward is a record by the artist duo kozek hörlonski (Peter Kozek + Thomas Hörl) celebrating 100 years of Kunstverein Baden and its members. I liked the idea that the vinyl itself looks kind of neutral by using the same card board as in the archives of Kunstverein. I was intrigued by the thought when the record is filed amongst all the other boxes in the archive it will suit immediately and become a part of history. 


The title makes use of the typeface Akzidenz Grotesk—in reminiscence of its progressive past, which pointed  at the same time into a neutral future, it seemed to be a good fit for the record’s title.
