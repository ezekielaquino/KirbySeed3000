Text: A rough, grey cardboard encloses this publication by Swiss artist Doris Lasch, whose praxis is mainly dealing with photography and its representation. Like a projection surface the cover depicts two, parallel moving film clips. The book title can be seen as being part of this projection, like a film that is just starting. By this, it incorporates an essential element of the artists’ works which is the question of ‘staging’ and ‘scenography’: Are the spaces which are shown in her photographies artificially staged for the camera or do they just show a very existing, natural moment. The publication follows this filmic atmosphere and uses the sequence of the pages to emphasise and to play with this specific relation in Lasch’s work.
