Text: n+f is a Vienna-based, artist-run company producing bedsheets designed by artists and designers in limited editions of 100. Literally, it offers the possibility to encounter art in a very intimate way. The design of the webshop plays with iconic elements of the night: The user is welcomed by a “performing” moon who is dancing in front of the stars. The stars build a constant background, while the various subpages are characterised by changing, sometimes absurd, color combinations, that can be associated with the different phases of the night.
