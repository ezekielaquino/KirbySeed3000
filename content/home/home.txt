Quickie:

## Quickie

All the files you need to edit and compile to create a site is
located in /source. Site templates and snippets are in the folder "site"
and all other assets are in their coressponding directories. Enjoy!

- I suggest dragging 'source' into your favorite editor, and try editing a template or /source/stylus/base.styl
- See the browser live reload!
- Build your site
- Ship it!
- Documentation is located at (link: http://github.com/ezekielaquino/KirbySeed3000 text: Github)-

### Important!

Now you're reading this, this is served to you via BrowserSync/proxy. To go to the panel,
