Text: 

There has never been a full agreement as to what were the key influences on Kurt Schwitters when he was preparing his sound poem “Ursonate” (1922–1932). There is one myth that claims he was inspired by bird sounds.
I strongly believe this to be true and bring the birds their Ursonate back, their primordial song. “Urbirds singing the Sonata” narrate what Kurt Schwitters might have heard when he wrote the poem.
