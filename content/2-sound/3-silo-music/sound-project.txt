    A generous, non-delicate uttering, even
    audible in the great distance of the
    urban environment; present and very
    centered with very little echo
    disturbances from the vacant site.

    From high up the volume drags to the
    ground and fades into the soil;
    unpleasantly rude like a ship’s horn
    right above your head.

    Suddenly a curious rattling sound is
    emitted which changes to a distinct
    musical note, reminding of a honking
    truck; followed by a flogging, like
    after a hard strike, rapidly fading tune
    with a metallic character. It comes over
    and over again. Very similar to the
    swing of a church bell with strikes that
    appear in very quick but irregular
    successions; so a new one begins while
    the preceding one still fades away.

  text: 'Vibrations accompanied by a booming low frequency during the discharge. Again short, sharp bursts of motion occur: shrill, particularly obnoxious. The silo cries, it’s screeching and quaking, it’s dynamic. Now, it’s so loud that it could ruin itself due to the vibrations, even causing its collapse.'

Text: 

Silo Music is the overall term of an acoustic phenomena which might occur during the discharge of a silo. These frequencies can cause heavy damages in the silo structure and its surroundings and challenge scientists worldwide. There are hardly any recordings of silo music probably because “the noise problem” is deemed to be solved rather than to be heard.
My text Silo Music is the notation of these unforeseeable sounds and is composed with the influence of the acoustic descriptions written by scientists. The notation was the starting point for the two Swiss musicians to sound the text within a free interpretation.
