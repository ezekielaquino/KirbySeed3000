Text: 

n+f is a Vienna-based, artist-run company producing bedsheets designed by artists and designers in limited editions of 100. Literally, it offers the possibility to encounter art in a very intimate way. The design of the webshop plays with iconic elements of the night: The user is welcomed by a “performing” moon who is dancing in front of the stars. The stars build a constant background, while the various subpages are characterised by changing, sometimes absurd, color combinations, that can be associated with the different phases of the night.
Outside of the usual work as graphic designer I was happy to design one of the bed linen and run in new dimensions!
