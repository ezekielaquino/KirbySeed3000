Text: I was invited to be a guest lecturer at New Design University in St. Pölten, AT. I dedicated the time with the students to engage with the visualisation of acoustics and different forms of transcription but all linked to one sound: The Big Bang is a sound of which we all are aware of but nobody knows how it actually sounds like or rather where the Big Bang has happened. During 4 months we tried to look back and demonstrate the genesis of the world in St. Pölten by transferring this very event in notations and creating a narration of both past and future. The book’s outcome is on the one hand a visual sound portrait of the city’s big bang and on the other hand a collection of notations which can be re-performed.
